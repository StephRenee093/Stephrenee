                <p>Since its release in December, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has been a fan favorite in my household. My children are huge Sonic fans, and ever since we watched the movie for the first time, it has become a regular feature in our home.</p>
                <p>From the fast-paced action to the hilarious moments, we all love how the film brings the characters to life in such an exciting way. When I was struggling to pick a topic for this project, my daughter came up with the amazing idea of creating a website to review the movie. </p>
                <p>It was the perfect choice, combining our shared love for Sonic with my need for a creative project, making this experience even more special.</p>

                <h2>Plot Overview</h2>
                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3, released on December 20, 2024, continues the high-speed adventures of the iconic blue hedgehog, Sonic, and his companions. Directed by Jeff Fowler, the film introduces new characters and delves deeper into the Sonic universe, offering audiences a blend of action, humor, and nostalgia.</p>
                <p>The narrative kicks off with the escape of Shadow the Hedgehog from a high-security G.U.N. facility, setting the stage for a formidable new adversary. Shadow, driven by a desire for vengeance due to past traumas, poses a threat unlike any Sonic and his friends have encountered. Meanwhile, Sonic, along with his loyal allies Tails and Knuckles, is celebrating the anniversary of his arrival on Earth. Their festivities are cut short when they are recruited by the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) to track down and neutralize Shadow before he can execute his destructive plans.</p>
                <p>The pursuit leads Team Sonic across various global locales, including Tokyo and London, culminating in intense confrontations with Shadow. Despite their combined strengths, Sonic and his team find themselves outmatched, prompting them to seek alliances in unexpected quarters. As the story unfolds, Shadow's tragic backstory is revealed, adding layers of complexity to his character and blurring the lines between heroism and villainy. </p>
